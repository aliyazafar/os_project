PROBLEM:

  IIUI canteen needs an automated inventory system to keep record of sales, items inventory and employees.
 Currently they are maintaining records on ledgers, but as their business is expanding day by day they need to
 automate their system for easy management and sales record. 

TABLES TO BE CREATED:
1)Item
2)Customer
3)Owner
4)Supervisor
5)Sales person
6)Sales order
7)Supplier
8)Supply


GOAL OF THE PROJECT:

	Our purpose is to form an automated system for the inventory of the canteen. This system will consist of a 
database system. The proposed system will try to minimize manual work involved. The main problem in the current 
system is to keep record of accounts and manual calculations of all the sales and then comparing cost prices for 
the calculation of profit. The proposed system will minimize these manual calculations and reports of profits will 
be generated automatically. In the end of month, owner is interested for the monthly profit. The proposed system 
will generate monthly report for the profit.
